## 📘 Abstract

This project presents a real-time and cloud-integrated monitoring system for Organ-on-Chip (OoC) platforms. The goal is to enable accurate drug testing without animal trials by using sensors and microcontrollers to collect and transmit biosignals for analysis.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Animal-based drug testing faces ethical and legal challenges. A technology-driven solution is needed to mimic organ behavior and allow real-time biomedical signal monitoring for safe drug validation.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Acquire biosignals in real time via sensors and a custom PCB  
- Process and transmit data using NI myRIO and LabVIEW  
- Store biomedical data on the cloud  
- Provide remote access through a mobile application

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- NI myRIO  
- LabVIEW  
- IoT-based cloud storage  
- Android mobile application  
- Custom signal conditioning PCB
